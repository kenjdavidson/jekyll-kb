# Jekyll Themee Bootstrap Starter

The more I've been playing with Jekyll themes the more I've been annoyed while starting out.  I wanted to create a project that would allow me to create a pretty decent scaffold for creating new themes (I found that I was starting out, hating, starting again) and wanted a better way.

## Installation

1. Clone the project and start making your own changes:

`git clone https://github.com/kenjdavidson/jekyll-theme-bootstrap-starter`

2. Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Once installed the JS and CSS/SCSS libraries will be copied.

## Included Frameworks

The following are standard frameworks or libraries which are included by default:

**[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)**
- SCSS copied to `_sass/bootstrap`
- JS copied to `assets/js/bootstrap`
- Includes JQuery and Popper dependencies

**[Scroll Magic](https://scrollmagic.io/)**
- JS copied to `assets/js/scrollmagic`

**[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)**
- Included in scripts but requires Jekyll theme configuration

**[Disqus](https://disqus.com/) (with configuration)**
- Included in scripts but requires Jekyll theme configuration
