A sample of all of the most common markdown features available for your editing enjoyment, provided by [adam-p/markdown-here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).  Updated code sections to use Jekyll Rouge highligther instead of backticks.

### H3
#### H4
##### H5

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1

## Emphasis

{% highlight markdown %}
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

<a name="lists"/>
## Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

{% highlight markdown %}
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

<a name="links"/>
## Links

There are two ways to create links.

{% highlight markdown %}
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code and syntax highlighting is done through Jekyll using the [Rouge highlighter](http://rouge.jneen.net/) which provides it's own set of configuration settings.  The styles for the highlighter are based on my own project [Base16scss](https://kenjdavidson.github.io/base16-scss/).  Code blocks are wrapped with

{% raw %}
{% highlight language [linenos] %}
// Code is entered here
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

All the available languages can be viewed at on the Rouge docs.


<a name="tables"/>
## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

{% highlight markdown %}
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

<a name="blockquotes"/>
## Blockquotes

{% highlight markdown %}
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Block quotes can be styled using the `class="THEME_COLOR"` addition, which will apply the border and background matching the selected *THEME_COLOR*.  To use the primary theme color we can use:

{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}
{:.primary}
> This is a primary blockquote.
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

{:.primary}
> This is a primary blockquote and should show the border and background using the appropriate color.   All theme-colors are available based on the bootstrap variables.

{:.success}
> This is a success blockquote and should show the border and background using the appropriate color.   All theme-colors are available based on the bootstrap variables.

{:.danger}
> This is a danger blockquote and should show the border and background using the appropriate color.   All theme-colors are available based on the bootstrap variables.

{:.info}
> This is a info blockquote and should show the border and background using the appropriate color.   All theme-colors are available based on the bootstrap variables.

<a name="html"/>
## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

{% highlight markdown %}
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
{% endhighlight %}

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="hr"/>
## Horizontal Rule

{% highlight markdown %}
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
{% endhighlight %}

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

{% highlight markdown %}
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
{% endhighlight %}

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...

(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)

<a name="videos"/>
## Youtube videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

{% highlight markdown %}
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
{% endhighlight %}

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

{% highlight markdown %}
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
{% endhighlight %}

Referencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1.
